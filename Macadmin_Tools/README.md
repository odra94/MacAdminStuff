## [Maccy](https://maccy.app/)

This is a clipboard manager. It is my personal favorite from all the ones that I have tried. You can make the list of things you copied from your mouse pointer. They also have a github where you can get it for free and try it out. If you like it you should support the creator.

[Maccy Github](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy).

## [Pasta](https://getpasta.com/)

This is another clipboard manager. It opens up a window that shows you the entries and you can pick which one you want to use. It is really nice and I was using it before Maccy. You can also use it for free and if you like it you can upgrade.

## [CopyClip](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copyclip-clipboard-history/id595191960?mt=12)

This is another clipboard manager but it lives on the top menu bar. It was [AndrewMBArnett's](https://github.com/AndrewMBarnett) first clipboard manager and he still uses it with Pasta.

## [FSMonitor](https://fsmonitor.com/)

This little application lets you see any changes in your filesystem. If you are trying to figure out where a setting gets set in a plist you run this and make the change and it should show you where it happened.

## [Icons](https://github.com/SAP/macOS-icon-generator)

This app helps you create icons for your applications. You drag and drop an application into it and it will make an install icon, an uninstall icon and an uninstall icon animation.

For example:

  <img src="/Macadmin_Tools/tool_icons/icns/uninstall.png" width="300;"/>

</p>

## [iMazing Profile Editor](https://imazing.com/profile-editor)

This app will help you define settings for Apple devices and you can deploy it with your MDM of choice.

## [Jamf Migrator](https://github.com/jamf/JamfMigrator)

Thos tool helps you migrate data between jamf servers. You will need to be careful in the order you migrate things because the order of how you transfer things matters. For example, if a category does not exist in the server you are transfering stuff to and you try to move a policy in that policy it will probably fail.
