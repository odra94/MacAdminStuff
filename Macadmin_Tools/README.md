# Tools For Macadmins

These are tools that can help in your daily work as a Macadmin. Some of them are used to streamline your day to day tasks and other can be used to automate processes for you.

## [HealthCheck](https://github.com/AndrewMBarnett/HealthCheck?tab=readme-ov-file)

HealthCheck is a script to update progress with swiftDialog including Inventory, Policy Check In, Jamf Protect Check In.

## [Apparency](https://mothersruin.com/software/Apparency/)

This app gives you information on other Apps. It takes over the preview for Apps when you press space. It gives you more useful information.

## [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)

This app allows you to thoroughly uninstall applications from your mac. You just need to drag an application to into it and it will take care of finding everything for an app so it can remove it.

## [Maccy](https://maccy.app/)

This is a clipboard manager. It is my personal favorite from all the ones that I have tried. You can make the list of things you copied from your mouse pointer. They also have a github where you can get it for free and try it out. If you like it you should support the creator.

## [Pasta](https://getpasta.com/)

This is another clipboard manager. It opens up a window that shows you the entries and you can pick which one you want to use. It is really nice and I was using it before Maccy.
