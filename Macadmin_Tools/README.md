## [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)

## [Maccy](https://maccy.app/)

This is a clipboard manager. It is my personal favorite from all the ones that I have tried. You can make the list of things you copied from your mouse pointer. They also have a github where you can get it for free and try it out. If you like it you should support the creator.

## [Pasta](https://getpasta.com/)

This is another clipboard manager. It opens up a window that shows you the entries and you can pick which one you want to use. It is really nice and I was using it before Maccy. You can also use it for free and if you like it you can upgrade.

## [CopyClip](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copyclip-clipboard-history/id595191960?mt=12)

This is another clipboard manager but it lives on the top menu bar. It was [AndrewMBArnett's](https://github.com/AndrewMBarnett) first clipboard manager and he still uses it with Pasta.

## [FSMonitor](https://fsmonitor.com/)

This little application lets you see any changes in your filesystem. If you are trying to figure out where a setting gets set in a plist you run this and make the change and it should show you where it happened.
