## [Setup Your Mac](https://github.com/setup-your-mac/Setup-Your-Mac)

Setup Your Mac aims to simplify initial device configuration by leveraging swiftDialog and Jamf Pro Policy Custom Events to allow end-users to self-complete Mac setup post-enrollment.

Also check out Dan K. Snelson's blog post about it [here](https://snelson.us/2024/06/setup-your-mac-1-15-0-with-sym-helper-1-2-0-via-swiftdialog-2-5-0/).

## [App Auto Patch](https://github.com/robjschroeder/App-Auto-Patch)

This is a script that helps you patch applications through a nice dialog window. It checks installed applications on your device and then uses installomator to update them if there is any new updates available.

## [SUPERMAN](https://github.com/Macjutsu/super)

This tool helps with the macOS updates in your environment. It gets deployeed to your environment and eventually forces people to update based on your configurations.

## [Apparency](https://mothersruin.com/software/Apparency/)

This app gives you information on other Apps. It takes over the preview for Apps when you press space. It gives you more useful information.

## [Maccy](https://maccy.app/)

This is a clipboard manager. It is my personal favorite from all the ones that I have tried. You can make the list of things you copied from your mouse pointer. They also have a github where you can get it for free and try it out. If you like it you should support the creator.

[Maccy Github](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy).

## [Pasta](https://getpasta.com/)

This is another clipboard manager. It opens up a window that shows you the entries and you can pick which one you want to use. It is really nice and I was using it before Maccy. You can also use it for free and if you like it you can upgrade.

For example:

## [Jamf Migrator](https://github.com/jamf/JamfMigrator)

Thos tool helps you migrate data between jamf servers. You will need to be careful in the order you migrate things because the order of how you transfer things matters. For example, if a category does not exist in the server you are transfering stuff to and you try to move a policy in that policy it will probably fail.
