# Elastic Downloads

This script will help you install Elastic and its different parts on Macs with Apple Silicon or Intel chips.

The variables that you will edit are:

`ENROLLMENT_TOKEN`

`ENROLLMENT_URL`

`AGENT_VERSION`

The enrollment token and URL you will need to get from whoever manages your Elastic console because depending on those the
download will actually get different components to put on your device.

The agent version is just whichever is the latest version your organization is deploying.
